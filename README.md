# iare-nitw-iot-session
My official repo for a session by NIT W and IARE on IoT Application Development

# Process
1. End-Device <br/>
Step - 1: Connect Sensor with Arduino <br/>
Step - 2: You have to read data from Arduino <br/>
Step - 3: The data read by Arduino has to be sent to IoT Gateway <br/> 
2. IoT Gateway <br/>
Step - 4: Gateway has to receive data from Arduino <br/>
3. AWS <br/>
Step - 5: You have to create an account in AWS <br/>
Step - 6: You have to create an instance (ubuntu) - Elastic Compute Engine <br/>
Step - 7: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
Step - 8: Launch MQTT Broker (Mosquitto) on AWS - sudo apt-get install mosquitto <br/>
